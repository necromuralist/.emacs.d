Emacs Configuration
===================

This is my emacs configuration (just the `init.el` right now). It probably has stuff in it that I don't use anymore, but I think most of it is for things I currently use. My plan is to convert it to an org-babel file so that I can, hopefully, keep it better documented and thus more current.
